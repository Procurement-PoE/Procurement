* Search/filter your stash/tabs for gear/items
* Search for gear based on item stats
* Show where items are in your stash, that form part of vendor recipes
* View your characters/gear
* Oneclick generate forum trade posts that you can copy&paste into a trade post, which will have all your gear linked, verified and categorised in spoiler tags.
* Customise how your shop thread gets generated
* Breakdown of your currency with Chaos total (Ratios configurable)
* Everything is cached and can be viewed offline after you've logged in once
* Single tab refreshing (if logged in) 

* Manual item selection by one to sell from any tab
* Copy item data as text (press Ctrl+C on item)
